Malicious IP Lookup

This is my first attempt to create a program that would allow a user to do an IP lookup and have it checked against multiple source.
Currently it only works with IP's, but I plan on adding URL checking.


By default the following websites are checked for the IP:

https://www.binarydefense.com/banlist.txt

https://www.binarydefense.com/tor.txt

https://reputation.alienvault.com/reputation.unix

http://malc0de.com/bl/IP_Blacklist.txt

http://www.malwaredomainlist.com/hostslist/mdl.xml
